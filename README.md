# Darwin

The purpose of this project was to develop my ability to make an MVP of any design I made from the ground up. I thought I'd design a simple website, manage how the server and data is handled. It really helped me to understand the full stack of web dev and get up to date on latest industry tools

## Live Demo:

## How it works

This backend is relatively simple, build with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), the sever runs on the [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) framework. The front end uses [angular 1](https://angularjs.org/).

The data is obtained using [Reddit's Api](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/).

The site is also attached to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Database and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).
